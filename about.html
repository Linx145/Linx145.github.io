            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is <span style="color: yellow;">Linus</span>, better known as <span style="color: yellow;">Linx145</span>. I'm an <span style="color: yellow;">18 year old</span> student
                currently studying at Singapore Polytechnic. I'm also the founder and
                director of <span style="color: violet;">Cloud of Pinky LLP</span>, an indie game development company focused
                on <span style="color: yellow;">telling</span> stories through our games, pioneering new and <span style="color: yellow;">more efficient
                technologies</span> and making the world <span style="color: yellow;">a better place</span> one person at a time.

            <p>
                Currently working on our flagship product, <span style="color: yellow;">Harpy Raiders</span>, I draw upon my rich imaginations
                and surreal dreamscapes of which I remember vividly to provide me with inspiration that is out
                of this world. In Somnio Omnia Licent - In a dream, anything is possible, and we at Cloud of Pinky
                <span style="color: yellow;">dare to dream</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond my role as project lead, I am many things. A programmer with <span style="color: yellow;">9 years of experience</span>, 
                a pixel artist with <span style="color: yellow;">6 years of experience</span>. A writer, a designer, an amateur musician. If there is a project that needs to be completed,
                you can count on me and my hyperfocus to get things done.
            </p>

            <p>Besides Linus, I am also host to various other alters. This is a space just for them! </p>

                <h1 style="text-align: center;"">Amgathega/Eli</h1>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;"">The Star of Innocence</h3>
                <img src="assets/Amgathega.png" class="portrait"></img>
                <p>Amgathega is my youngest alter. In the dream, we live in the same 
                condominium complex and thus often go on adventures together! 
                He's an adventurous and free-spirited boy who appreciates being in nature.
                Overall, really nice guy :D</p>

                <img src="assets/Russell.png" class="portrait"></img>
                <p>Russell is the sole 'fictive' member of the system. Hailing from the game End Roll,
                    Russell remains a deranged maniac when he speaks to me. Nonetheless, I love him
                    very much as he is like a brother to me, as questionable as his takes are.
                    (Sometimes, he wants me to off myself)

                <h1 style="text-align: center;"">Eternal Grasaei</h1>

                <img src="assets/Eternal.png" class="portrait"></img>
                <p>Eternal wants very much to be my girlfriend. She loves me, all of me, but
                    especially my corporeal form. She also wants to do unspeakable things to
                    innocent civilians. To calm her down, I let her control my body every now and
                    then. I find her kind of cute. Do not give her a knife.
                </p>

                <img src="assets/Latisha.png" class="portrait"></img>
                <p>Latisha Sunhill is my sister. Her goals yet elude me, though it
                    seems to be ambitious beyond ambition. To this end, she plans on acquiring a massive
                    amount of wealth and influence so as to enact her plans. Though I have to
                    keep her wrath in check sometimes, she is very much the caretaker within the system.
                    It was through her enlightenment that I found a new purpose in life.
